# Heart-Disease-Prediction

Overview
This repository contains a machine learning model for heart disease prediction, achieving an impressive accuracy of 81%. The primary goal of this project is to aid healthcare professionals in early detection and prevention of heart-related issues, ultimately improving patient outcomes.

Dataset
The model is trained on a comprehensive and carefully curated dataset that includes a diverse set of health-related attributes, such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, exercise habits, and other vital factors. This extensive dataset forms the foundation for training and evaluating the predictive capabilities of the model.

Model Performance
The model has been rigorously evaluated using various performance metrics through extensive testing and cross-validation, we achieved an accuracy of 81%, ensuring reliable predictions for potential heart disease cases.
